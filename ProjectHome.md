Gizmic OS is an Open Source Operating System programmed in Free Pascal and assembler.

I started this project to improve my programming and to create a small fast OS that I hope will oneday be able to perform simple multitasking word processing and run basic games.

Those are my goals so far. This is my 1st OS and hopefully there will be many more to come.

Feel free to use my code to help you learn or just to have fun with.
